# Student Commute Optimizer

## 1. Summary 

**Student Commute Optimizer** is a mobile-first app that helps students discover and coordinate shared rides by matching overlapping routes and compatible times. It is designed to be: **private** (pseudonyms + coarse location), **accurate** (route geometry matching with PostGIS), and **fast** (caching + corridor search). The MVP focuses on onboarding via college email, seamless route creation, real-time match discovery, and in-app anonymous chat.

**Key value proposition for reviewers:** reduces vehicle count, cuts student commute costs, and demonstrates practical geospatial engineering (PostGIS) and real-time features (WebSocket). Good technical depth while respecting privacy.

## 2. Architecture — visual (ASCII)

**Notes:** the Match Service uses PostGIS spatial indices for corridor and overlap checks; it queries Redis for active, in-memory trip info to keep latency low.

---

## 3. Sequence flow — find & chat (short)

1. Student A creates a trip (origin, destination, depart window). Frontend POSTs to `/trips/create`.
2. API stores trip in Postgres (route geometry returned from Routing API) and pushes job to `matching` queue.
3. Match worker reads job → queries PostGIS for ST\_DWithin candidates → computes overlap scores → writes top matches to Redis and notifies Student A via push/WebSocket.
4. Student A opens a match → WebSocket channel created (chat room tied to match id) → anonymous chat begins.
5. Student fixes the ride.

## 5. PostGIS schema 

```// User flow
FUNCTION createUser(college_id, pseudonym, real_name, profile_meta):
    user.id = generateUUID()
    user.college_id = college_id
    user.pseudonym = pseudonym
    user.real_name_hash = hash(real_name)
    user.profile_meta = profile_meta
    user.created_at = currentTimestamp()
    SAVE user
    RETURN user


// Trip flow
FUNCTION createTrip(user_id, origin_point, destination_point, depart_window, seats):
    trip.id = generateUUID()
    trip.user_id = user_id
    trip.origin = origin_point
    trip.destination = destination_point
    trip.route_geom = callRoutingAPI(origin_point, destination_point)
    trip.depart_start = depart_window.start
    trip.depart_end = depart_window.end
    trip.seats_available = seats
    trip.status = "planned"
    trip.created_at = currentTimestamp()
    SAVE trip
    RETURN trip


// Matching trips (simplified)
FUNCTION findMatches(new_trip):
    candidate_trips = queryTripsWithinRadius(new_trip.route_geom)
    scored_trips = []
    FOR each trip IN candidate_trips:
        overlap = computeRouteOverlap(new_trip.route_geom, trip.route_geom)
        IF overlap > threshold:
            scored_trips.append({trip, overlap})
    SORT scored_trips BY overlap DESC
    RETURN topN(scored_trips)


// Reservation / joining a trip
FUNCTION joinTrip(trip_id, user_id):
    trip = getTrip(trip_id)
    IF trip.seats_available > 0 AND trip.status == "planned":
        reserveSeat(trip, user_id)
        trip.seats_available -= 1
        SAVE trip
        RETURN "success"
    ELSE:
        RETURN "no seats available"

```

## 6. Key PostGIS queries (core matching) 

**Find candidates within corridor (\~500 meters)**

FUNCTION findCandidates(new_trip_route, new_trip_id):
    candidates = EMPTY_LIST

    FOR each trip IN trips_table:
        IF trip.status == "planned"
           AND trip.id != new_trip_id
           AND distanceBetween(trip.route_geom, new_trip_route) <= 500 meters:
               ADD (trip.id, trip.user_id, trip.route_geom) TO candidates

    RETURN up to 200 candidates
    ```

---
**
**Compute overlap length with a candidate (SQL snippet)****

FUNCTION computeOverlapRatio(tripA_id, tripB_id):

    // Step 1: Load route geometries
    routeA = getRouteGeometry(tripA_id)
    routeB = getRouteGeometry(tripB_id)

    // Step 2: Compute lengths of each route
    lengthA = computeLength(routeA)
    lengthB = computeLength(routeB)

    // Step 3: Compute intersection geometry
    intersectionGeom = computeIntersection(routeA, routeB)

    // Step 4: Compute overlap length
    overlapLength = computeLength(intersectionGeom)

    // Step 5: Normalize by shorter route
    overlapRatio = overlapLength / MIN(lengthA, lengthB)

    RETURN overlapRatio

---

## 7. Compact matching pseudocode

```
FUNCTION findMatches(trip_id):
    new_trip = loadTripFromDB(trip_id)

    // Step 1: Find spatial candidates within a corridor
    candidates = spatialQuery(new_trip.route_geom, corridor_radius = 500 meters)

    matches = EMPTY_LIST

    // Step 2: Score each candidate
    FOR each candidate IN candidates:
        overlap_meters = computeRouteOverlap(new_trip, candidate)

        overlap_ratio = overlap_meters 
                        / MIN(new_trip.length, candidate.length)

        time_score = computeTimeWindowOverlap(
                        new_trip.depart_start, new_trip.depart_end,
                        candidate.depart_start, candidate.depart_end
                     )

        proximity_score = computePickupProximity(
                            new_trip.origin, candidate.origin
                          )

        final_score = (0.6 * overlap_ratio) 
                      + (0.3 * time_score) 
                      + (0.1 * proximity_score)

        // Step 3: Apply threshold
        IF final_score > 0.35:
            ADD (candidate.id, final_score) TO matches

    // Step 4: Sort matches by score, highest first
    SORT matches BY final_score DESCENDING

    // Step 5: Return top 10
    RETURN first 10 items from matches

```

## 8. Scoring — quick math explanation (showing trade-offs)

* If routes overlap 50% (0.5), time window overlap 0.8, proximity 0.5 → `score = 0.6*0.5 + 0.3*0.8 + 0.1*0.5 = 0.3 + 0.24 + 0.05 = 0.59` — a strong match.
* Judges will appreciate a clear threshold rationale (e.g. `>0.35` accepts reasonable detours but avoids weak matches).

## 9. Safety & privacy 

* **Pseudonym + College verification:** ensures each account is linked to a real student but identity is hidden.
* **Minimal location sharing:** discovery coordinates rounded to 50m to avoid precise tracking.
* **Mutual reveal:** identity only revealed when both parties explicitly consent.
* **Moderation:** one-click reporting, automated filters, manual review pipeline.
